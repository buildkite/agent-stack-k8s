# Prometheus metrics

All metrics exported by agent-stack-k8s begin with `buildkite_`. The second
component of the metric name refers to the controller component that produces
the metric.

## Notes on using the metrics

Most metrics below are counter metrics, designed to be used in conjunction with
the `rate` and a time window. These are named ending in `_total`. 
PromQL examples:

- `rate(buildkite_scheduler_job_create_success_total[10m])` - jobs successfully
  created per second over a 10 minute window
- `rate(buildkite_scheduler_job_create_errors_total[10m])` - errors per second
  of failures to create jobs over a 10 minute window

Some metrics are gauges, which can be useful for diagnosing particular issues.

A few metrics are native histograms, which requires the Prometheus feature flag
to be enabled (`--enable-feature=native-histograms`). These are mostly latency
histograms named ending in `_seconds`, and again work well with `rate`:

- `rate(buildkite_job_end_to_end_seconds[10m])` - histogram of time in seconds
  that jobs spent between being returned from a query to Buildkite and being
  created in Kubernetes, over a 10 minute window
- `rate(buildkite_monitor_job_query_seconds[10m])` - histogram of time spent
  querying Buildkite for jobs that can be scheduled, over a 10 minute window

## Labels and their meanings

Label name | Description | Values
--- | --- | ---
`source` | The event that caused a counter to increase. | <ul><li>`Handle` - the previous component</li><li>`OnAdd` - the Kubernetes Informer (e.g. an existing job, or a job created by another instance of agent-stack-k8s)</li><li>`OnDelete` - the Kubernetes Informer (e.g. the job was deleted externally)</li><li>`OnUpdate` - the Kubernetes Informer (e.g. the job was modified externally or changed state automatically)</li></ul>
`reason`, `error_reason` | For operations on Kubernetes, the Kubernetes reason associated with an error | Examples <ul><li>`TooManyRequests` - the Kubernetes server is overloaded</li><li>`AlreadyExists` - the resource (e.g. job) already exists in the cluster</li><li>`Invalid` - the resource (e.g. job) couldn't be created because it was invalid</li></ul>
`reason` | For the limiter, a classification of the error returned by the downstream component | <ul><li>`duplicate` - a latter component or Kubernetes determined the job is a duplicate</li><li>`stale` - the job was cancelled or no longer existed by the time it was possible to start work on it</li><li>`other` - some other error prevented the job from being handled</li></ul>
`eviction_reason` | The reason an eviction was created | <ul><li>`image_pull_failure` - One or more container images couldn't be pulled within a timeout<li>`bk_job_cancelled` - The corresponding Buildkite job was cancelled on Buildkite</li></ul>
