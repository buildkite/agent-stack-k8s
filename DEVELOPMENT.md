Agent Stack K8s Development
===

# Local Dependencies
Install dependencies with Homebrew via:

```bash
brew bundle
```

Run tasks via [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

```bash
just --list
```

# Integration Tests

## Architecture

Agent Stack K8s integration tests depend on a running Buildkite instance. By default, they use the production Buildkite.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    c((Controller)) -->|create jobs| K
    Buildkite <-->|Pull jobs| c
    subgraph K8s cluster
        K(Kube API)
    end
```

During test run, the test suites:
1. create ephemeral pipelines and queues for a given [Buildkite Agent Cluster](https://buildkite.com/docs/clusters/overview).
2. Run executor, which will monitor jobs from the target queue in target Buildkite Cluster,
   starts new Jobs in a Kubernetes cluster.
3. Test suite will clean up those ephemeral objects in the end.

To run integration test locally, we recommend you to run individual test. For example,

```bash
just test -run TestWalkingSkeleton
```

## Setup

Any member of the public should be able to run our integration as long as you are an user of Buildkite, and you have
access to a Kubernetes cluster.

Concretely, to get the integration test running locally, you will need:
1. A valid Buildkite API token (presuming you are a customer of Buildkite).
2. A valid Buildkite Agent Token in your target Buildkite Cluster. The agent token needs to be installed in your K8s
   cluster.
3. Your organization name in Buildkite and your target Buildkite Cluster UUID.
4. Depending on test cases, you may also need a SSH keys, please read below.
5. Your shell environment will need CLI write access to a k8s cluster.

### Use environment variables

We found it's convenient to supply API token, organization name, and cluster UUID as environment variables.

```bash
export BUILDKITE_TOKEN="bkua_**************"
export ORG="your-cool-org-slug"
export CLUSTER_UUID="UUID-UUID-UUID-UUID"
```

### Token Scopes

Required Buildkite API token scopes:

- `read_artifacts`
- `read_build_logs`
- `write_pipelines`
- `write_clusters`

### Install Agent Token

Agent token is used by the k8s jobs instead of controller, so:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic buildkite-agent-token --from-literal=BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN=my-agent-token
```

### SSH secret

You'll also need to create an SSH secret in your cluster to run [this test pipeline](internal/integration/fixtures/secretref.yaml). This SSH key needs to be associated with your GitHub account to be able to clone this public repo, and must be in a form acceptable to OpenSSH (aka `BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY`, not `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`).

```bash
kubectl create secret generic agent-stack-k8s --from-file=SSH_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_github
```

## Debugging
The integration tests on the [`kubernetes-agent-stack`](https://buildkite.com/buildkite-kubernetes-stack/kubernetes-agent-stack) pipeline will create additional pipelines in the [`buildkite-kubernetes-stack`](https://buildkite.com/buildkite-kubernetes-stack) organization.


## Cleanup

In general, pipelines and queues will be deleted automatically for successful tests, but for unsuccessful tests, then will remain after then end of the test job to allow you to debug them.

To do clean them up:

```bash
just cleanup-orphans
```

The token will need to have GraphQL access as well as:
- `read_artifacts`
- `write_pipelines`

This is usually enough, but there is another situation where the cluster could be clogged with K8s jobs.
To clean these out you should run the following in a kubernetes context in the namespace containing the controller used to run the CI pipeline.
```bash
kubectl get -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' jobs | xargs -L1 kubectl delete job
```

## CI ‚ù§Ô∏è  Integration Test

At the time of writing, the CI pipeline run in an EKS cluster, `agent-stack-k8s-ci` in the `buildkite-agent` AWS account.
CI deployes the controller onto `buildkite` namespace in that cluster.

# Run from source

Running from the source can be useful for debugging purpose, you will generally need to meet the same requirement of
running a integration test.

In this case, you can choose to supply some inputs via CLI parameters instead of environment variable.

```bash!
just run --org my-org --buildkite-token my-api-token --debug
```

## Local Deployment with Helm

`just deploy` will build the container image using [ko](https://ko.build/) and
deploy it with [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

You'll need to have set `KO_DOCKER_REPO` to a repository you have push access
to. For development something like the [kind local
registry](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/) or the [minikube
registry](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry) can be used. More
information is available at [ko's
website](https://ko.build/configuration/#local-publishing-options).

You'll also need to provide required configuration values to Helm, which can be done by passing extra args to `just`:

```bash
just deploy --values config.yaml
```

With config.yaml being a file containing [required Helm values](values.yaml), such as:

```yaml
agentToken: "abcdef"
graphqlToken: "12345"
config:
  org: "my-buildkite-org"
```

The `config` key contains configuration passed directly to the binary, and so supports all the keys documented in [the example](examples/config.yaml).
